Hi Laurent,

My last modifications was “Version 6”, which I put it on dropbox before our meeting. I added the appendix at the end of the paper. If you see the appendix in your version, then we are safe. 

I think the notifications of the dropbox is not immediate and it refers to the changes that I made on Tuesday. 

Bon week-end,
Navid
